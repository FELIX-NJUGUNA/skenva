## **🚀 Installation & Setup**
### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js **v16+**
- npm or yarn installed  

### **Installation**
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FELIX-NJUGUNA/skenva.git

# Navigate to project folder
cd skenva

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the steps to get a local copy of Skenva up and running on your machine. By following these steps, you'll be able to explore the project's features, make modifications, and even contribute to its development.

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   **Node.js**: Version 16 or higher. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
-   **npm** or **yarn**: These are package managers for JavaScript. npm is included with Node.js. If you prefer yarn, you can install it from [yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com/).

### **Setting Up the Project**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the Skenva repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/FELIX-NJUGUNA/skenva.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    Change your current directory to the newly cloned `skenva` folder:
    ```sh
    cd skenva
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all the project dependencies using either npm or yarn. This command will download and install all the necessary packages defined in the `package.json` file.
    ```sh
    # Using npm
    npm install

    # Or using yarn
    # yarn install
    ```

4.  **Start the Development Server:**
    Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the local development server:
    ```sh
    # Using npm
    npm run dev

    # Or using yarn
    # yarn dev
    ```

5.  **View in Browser:**
    After the development server starts (you'll typically see a message like `VITE vX.Y.Z  ready in XXX ms`), open your web browser and navigate to:
    [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

    You should now see the Skenva website running locally!

Now you're all set to explore the codebase, experiment with changes, or start building new features.

## 🤔 Troubleshooting

Encountering issues? Here are some common problems and how to resolve them.

*   **Installation/Dependency Issues:**
    *   **Error related to Node.js version:**
        *   **Symptom:** You see an error message during installation like `Unsupported engine` or `requires Node.js version X but found Y`.
        *   **Solution:** Skenva requires Node.js v16 or higher. Check your Node.js version by running `node -v`. If it's outdated, update Node.js. We recommend using a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to easily switch between Node.js versions.
        ```sh
        # Example: Install and use Node.js v18 with nvm
        nvm install 18
        nvm use 18
        ```
    *   **`npm install` fails:**
        *   **Symptom:** The `npm install` command fails with errors, often related to package conflicts or network issues.
        *   **Solution:**
            1.  Delete `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) and the `node_modules` folder.
            2.  Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force` (for yarn, try `yarn cache clean`).
            3.  Try installing again: `npm install` (or `yarn install`).
            4.  Ensure you have a stable internet connection.
            5.  If specific packages fail, check their documentation for known issues or try installing them individually.

*   **Development Server Issues:**
    *   **Development server (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`) doesn't start:**
        *   **Symptom:** The command finishes abruptly or throws an error like "Port already in use".
        *   **Solution:**
            *   **Port Conflicts:** Another application might be using the default port (usually 5173 for Vite). Try running the server on a different port: `npm run dev -- --port 5174` or `yarn dev --port 5174`.
            *   **Missing Dependencies:** Ensure all dependencies were installed correctly. Try deleting `node_modules` and reinstalling (see "`npm install` fails" above).
            *   Check the terminal output for specific error messages that can guide you.
    *   **Changes not reflecting in the browser:**
        *   **Symptom:** You make changes to the code, but the website in your browser doesn't update.
        *   **Solution:**
            1.  Ensure the development server is still running in your terminal.
            2.  Try a hard refresh in your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R).
            3.  Clear your browser cache and cookies for the site.
            4.  Check the browser's developer console (usually F12) for any errors that might be preventing updates.
            5.  Ensure your file saving triggers the Hot Module Replacement (HMR). Sometimes, IDEs or file systems might have issues with file watching.

*   **Build Issues:**
    *   **`npm run build` (or `yarn build`) fails:**
        *   **Symptom:** The build process terminates with errors.
        *   **Solution:**
            *   **TypeScript Errors:** If the project uses TypeScript, look for type errors in the console output. Resolve these errors in your `.ts` or `.tsx` files.
            *   **Linting Issues:** Code linting errors (e.g., from ESLint) can also stop the build. Fix the reported linting problems.
            *   **Missing Dependencies:** A dependency required for the build might be missing. Check the error messages for clues.
            *   **Resource Limits:** Large projects might sometimes exceed memory limits during build. Try increasing the memory available to Node.js (e.g., `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096 npm run build`).

*   **Performance/Display Issues:**
    *   **Images not loading or animations not working:**
        *   **Symptom:** Image placeholders are shown, or animations are jerky/absent.
        *   **Solution:**
            *   **Check Paths:** Verify that image paths in your code are correct and that the image files exist in the `public` folder or are correctly imported/referenced from `src/assets`. Case sensitivity can be an issue.
            *   **Browser Console:** Open the browser's developer console (F12). The "Console" tab will show errors (e.g., 404 Not Found for images), and the "Network" tab can show failed requests.
            *   **CSS Issues:** Incorrect CSS might hide elements or interfere with animations. Use browser developer tools to inspect the relevant elements.
            *   For animations, ensure that Framer Motion (or other animation libraries) is correctly installed and imported.
